<h3><strong>The training period would be six months or longer. Self-motived Ph.D. (or master) students, who aim at top-tier NLP conferences or other significant contributions to machine translation community, are welcome to send me your CV. </p> 
 
 There are sufficient computational resources (58 Tesla P100 and dozens of K80 et al.) and comfortable office environment
 in NICT. NICT would cover nearly all of the cost, such as transportation from/to your country, an independent apartment (including the furniture, daily necessities, water, electricity, gas, and network fee et al.) as accommodation, daily transportation fee, health insurance  et al. and provide additional considerable allowance (around 90,000JPY (800USD) per month, only for abroad students) for your other daily spending. </p>
