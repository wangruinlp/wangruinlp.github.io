<h3>Short Bio <strong><a class="grey" href="cv.pdf">[Full CV]</a></strong></h3>
<blockquote>
I am a tenure-track researcher at NICT, working with Dr. <strong><a class="grey" href="http://www2.nict.go.jp/astrec-att/member/mutiyama/">Masao Utiyama</a></strong> and Dr. <strong><a class="grey" href="http://att-astrec.nict.go.jp/member/sumita/index.html">Eiichiro Sumita</a></strong>. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2016, supervised by Prof. <strong><a class="grey" href="http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/">Bao-Liang Lu</a></strong> and Prof. <strong><a class="grey" href="http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhaohai/">Hai Zhao</a></strong>. I was also a joint Ph.D. student (Le programme Cai Yuanpei from 2013 to 2015) in CNRS-University Lyon1, supervised by Prof. <strong><a class="grey" href="http://l2c2.isc.cnrs.fr/drupal7/fr/node/1649">Sabine Ploux</a></strong>. I obtained my master and bachelor degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Harbin Institute of Technology in 2012 and 2009, respectively.</p> 

My research focuses on machine translation,  a classic task in NLP (or even in AI). I (as the first or corresponding authors) have published more than 20 MT papers in top-tier NLP conferences and journals, such as ACL, EMNLP, COLING, AAAI, IJCAI, TASLP, TALLIP, etc. I have also won the first places on several language pairs of WMT shared tasks, such as the unsupervised Czech<->German task in 2019 and the supervised Finnish/Estonian<->English tasks in 2018. I servered as the area co-chairs of CCL-2018/2019 and the organization co-chairs of PACLIC-29 and YCCL-2012.</p>

I was a fan of 郑渊洁, Pavel Nedvěd (in Lazio, I often use it as my WMT system name), Omaha hold'em (hi-lo), and 郭德纲.
