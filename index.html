Dr. Rui Wang is a computational linguist working as a researcher (tenured) in NICT. His research focuses on machine translation (MT),  a classic task in NLP (or even in AI). His recent interests are traditional linguistic based and cutting-edge machine learning based approaches for MT. He (as the first or the corresponding authors) has published more than 30 MT papers in top-tier NLP/ML/AI conferences and journals, such as ACL, EMNLP, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, IEEE/ACM transactions, etc. He has also won several first places in top-tier MT/NLP shared tasks, such as WMT-2018, WMT-2019, WMT-2020, CoNLL-2019 etc. He served as an area chair of ICLR-2021.</p>
